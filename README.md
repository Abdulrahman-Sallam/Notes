I live in Egypt where the inflation is insane 30 to 55 %. and I have an offer where I can buy an **Apartment in a city that will be one of the most luxurious cities in Egypt.** on **14 years increasing loan** and will be able to receive the property after three to four years as **the city is still in development. I already have 2 million in cash** that I want to invest in gold or other things and pay the loans or mortgage from that and my **salary 18K net monthly.**  
***Could I afford it and is this a promising investment?***
